            <li>I wanted to read this book for a while and it was worth reading. It&#39;s a very intriguing story and thought provoking. It&#39;s not an easy read, but well worth the effor. The ending is probably not the great (the very last part) but the story is very interesting and as I said though provoking.</li>

            <li>If you are not an Armenian this could be a good way to understand feelings of Armenians about Armenian genocide! It has a very nice personal touch from the author that explains how he feels also give you some historical context of what actually happened, and why it&#39;s hard for an Armenian to tell you what happened.</li>
          
            <li>If you are Armennian, it&#39;s equally good. Book describes how the authorsfeel and I could related to a lot of his feeling and he put a lot of feelings into words which I really liked.</li>
