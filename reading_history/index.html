            <li>I liked this book even though it does not have very good reviews. I think I can contribute the liking to the fact that it&#39;s set in San Francisco, and it deals with how people would perceive something that don&#39;t understand.</li>

            <li>The ideas from the book really resonated with me. I had liked the movie based on this novel, but reading the book was even better.</li>
          
            <li>The book is full of ideas about what it takes to be a leader, how people come together in time of crisis, and how they still keep plotting against each other no matter what.</li>

            <li>This seemed like a more realistic version of American dream (I&#39;m not sure about correct meaning of this term). But it shows that there are a lot of different people even in the small town and that everyone is nice deep inside and it is not hard to live together instead of waging wars against each other. Wars distruct and take people for no reason. American way of life is to embrase leaving. Actually it&#39;s hard to identify the core meaning of this text, it has a lot of smaller ideas, like being homesick and necessity to have a home.</li>

            <li>Really recomend! It raises all the interesting questions about distinctions between androids and humans and how to classify one and another. Together with an interesting story that goes with it, creating culture just to be different from androids because we do things to be different. This goes along how people behave themselves too.</li>

          <li>I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David Lagercrantz, Ruth Urbom </li>

            <li>Date Read: 2015.05-2016.05</li>
          

          
            <li>Interesting to read what goes on in the mind of Zlatan. Other than that book is not very well organized, it seems like listening to a mind that strays away while telling its stories. Even with that it was an interesting read, you understand that even professional teams are supposed to be teams, and that professionals should have the desire to win to succeed.</li>

        <ul>
          

          
            <li>I really liked this book. It seems that it&#39;s a story of life compressed into a year. At the same time it is also a look into a mind that you don&#39;t understand. Both because you don&#39;t understand retarted people and you don&#39;t understand geniouses and different problems them face.</li>
          
            <li>It made me wonder if I&#39;m becoming Charlie the Scientist as I try to learn more of everything, because while doing that I feel like I&#39;m becoming lonelier than before. Maybe this is because of moving back to MIT, but still makes you think that smart and accomplished people are usually rude.</li>

            <li>If you are not an Armenian this could be a good way to understand feelings of Armenians about Armenian genocide! It has a very nice personal touch from the author that explains how he feels also give you some historical context of what actually happened, and why it&#39;s hard for an Armenian to tell you what happened.</li>
          
            <li>If you are Armennian, it&#39;s equally good. Book describes how the authorsfeel and I could related to a lot of his feeling and he put a lot of feelings into words which I really liked.</li>

            <li>It was a nice book with a lot of examples of people that had characters. I like overall idea of the book and what it promotes, but I was not convinced by some of the examples it had. It made me think that US society is divided in a lot of parts, and the part that is non-South thinking (I don&#39;t know how else to discribe it), and has achieved something has a lot of values that that my parents taught me. So even though American mentality is far away from Armenian one, there is a set of core values of being human that is shared among both, but you have to dig for those and you only find those values in thinkers of the time.</li>

            <li>It was a good book to understand how Peter Thiel thinks about startups.
I definitely agree with a lot of points there, but I can not remember
which of the ideas came from this book which from somewhere else. I like
his 7 questions that all startups should ask themselves! It&#39;s a good
book if you are considering starting a startup.

            <li>I read this over long period if you consider that the book is only 150
pages long. It was a nice book, with a nice buildup of what the society
looks when people want to be happy all the time. Makes you think about
what is the life about like any other good fictional book. It was
entertaining, but I have read better scifi books.

            <li>Very nice book and it didn&#39;t take too long to finish it. I will
definitely read more of Arthur C. Clarke. This had a resemblence with
Childhood&#39;s end in a way that it says that human race is not the
dominant force in the universe.

            <li>It had interesting stories, I wouldn&#39;t say I loved the book, but it
was worth reading. Way better than other short stories I have read.
There was a sense that he was telling stories about people that live
in Dublin, but have very little in common.

it. Very entertaining, but dense and full of names that one must remember
when reading. Reading in Kindle helped a lot because of the X-Ray feature.
I&#39;m not sure if I liked it to recommend to someone not already liking Game
of Thrones of other works of Tolkein.

It makes you think about the values in life, and what is necessary for oneself to live. Very entertaining and I&#39;d recommend, the only downside is that it&#39;s a pretty dark novel.</li>

            <li>Very entertaining, my fist Lem novel. Written from first person. After Of Mice and Men I&#39;ve started noticing the way story is presented and how could it be converted to a movie so I should watch Solaris (2002) and see how they did.</li>
          
            <li>I really didn’t like Solaris (2002) movie, it tried to take some ideas out of the book (I didn’t get all of those ideas, but most of them) and force feeds to the audience. It solves all the narration by skipping it and creating a slightly different back story which doesn’t make much sense.</li>
          
            <li>(2015.12) I watched Andrei Tarkovsky&#39;s Solaris (1972) and I liked it a
lot. I think the movies made me look at the book in a slightly different
way. The quote that I remembered from the movies was that we were
looking for a contact with ET civilization but when we find it we have
no idea what to do with it. Another good one was that human race doesn&#39;t
want to conquer the universe, it wants to expand Earth to the boundaries
of the universe. Great movie! I think I should read the book again in a
year or so.
