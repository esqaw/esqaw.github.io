          <li>Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.11-12</li>
          

          
            <li>I read this over long period if you consider that the book is only 150
pages long. It was a nice book, with a nice buildup of what the society
looks when people want to be happy all the time. Makes you think about
what is the life about like any other good fictional book. It was
entertaining, but I have read better scifi books.

          <li>The City and The Stars by Arthur C. Clarke </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.11</li>
          

          
            <li>Very nice book and it didn&#39;t take too long to finish it. I will
definitely read more of Arthur C. Clarke. This had a resemblence with
Childhood&#39;s end in a way that it says that human race is not the
dominant force in the universe.

          <li>Dubliners by James Joyce </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.11</li>
          

          
            <li>It had interesting stories, I wouldn&#39;t say I loved the book, but it
was worth reading. Way better than other short stories I have read.
There was a sense that he was telling stories about people that live
in Dublin, but have very little in common.

          <li>The Silmarillion by J. R. R. Tolkein </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.1</li>
          

          
            <li>In the beginning I felt like reading the Bible, even though I haven&#39;t read
it. Very entertaining, but dense and full of names that one must remember
when reading. Reading in Kindle helped a lot because of the X-Ray feature.
I&#39;m not sure if I liked it to recommend to someone not already liking Game
of Thrones of other works of Tolkein.

            <li>This is a very entertaining book even though it&#39;s 1000 pages long! It&#39;s like reading Game of Thrones but in medieval Japan and without fantasy. I really recommend this book if you want entertainment and some basic insight into Japanese mentally and self control and cunning planing.</li>

            <li>Too slow to read, but it&#39;s probably worth listening to. Has some suggestions that are worth listening to, but probably is more useful at the work setting than anywhere else.</li>

            <li>I wanted to read this book for a while and it was worth reading. It&#39;s a very intriguing story and thought provoking. It&#39;s not an easy read, but well worth the effor. The ending is probably not the great (the very last part) but the story is very interesting and as I said though provoking.</li>

            <li>Very well written book, I liked it. It is Fiction but it seems so real that you think you are reading a history book about some person. It makes you think about the values in life, and what is necessary for oneself to live. Very entertaining and I&#39;d recommend, the only downside is that it&#39;s a pretty dark novel.</li>

            <li>The Foundation Trilogy is the best I’ve read! Probably better than the Song of Fire and Ice (we’ll see after it’s finished)</li>
          
            <li>But the amount of thought that is put into this book and how everything is connected and everything in the end makes sense. There is pretty much no false clues in the book (none that I saw).</li>

            <li>I really liked this book, recommend. I even bough “Ad herenium” after (while) reading this book</li>
          
            <li>It has interesting techniques about memory, also is written very nicely so it is very interesting to read.</li>
          
            <li>I need to learn the Major System for remembering numbers and of course practice the method of loci to be able to use this in real life. Foer says that he didn’t find good applications for the knowledge other than being human by remembering, I like this idea, but I need to try to find useful applications myself before I can agree with him.</li>

          <li>Solaris by Stanislaw Lem </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>Very entertaining, my fist Lem novel. Written from first person. After Of Mice and Men I&#39;ve started noticing the way story is presented and how could it be converted to a movie so I should watch Solaris (2002) and see how they did.</li>
          
            <li>I really didn’t like Solaris (2002) movie, it tried to take some ideas out of the book (I didn’t get all of those ideas, but most of them) and force feeds to the audience. It solves all the narration by skipping it and creating a slightly different back story which doesn’t make much sense.</li>
          
            <li>(2015.12) I watched Andrei Tarkovsky&#39;s Solaris (1972) and I liked it a
lot. I think the movies made me look at the book in a slightly different
way. The quote that I remembered from the movies was that we were
looking for a contact with ET civilization but when we find it we have
no idea what to do with it. Another good one was that human race doesn&#39;t
want to conquer the universe, it wants to expand Earth to the boundaries
of the universe. Great movie! I think I should read the book again in a
year or so.

            <li>Nice short read, very unconventional story</li>
          
            <li>It was interesting reading in this novellete/play style. He actually though about presenting at n different media not just writing a book, I guess you are at the next level when you come up with a story and can present it in different media simultaneously without hurting the story</li>

            <li>Need to read couple more novels by Clarke</li>
          
            <li>Lots of ideas from this book are reused, V TV Series picks where this book starts and tries to take an alternative path, but their path was pretty mediocre.</li>

            <li>This is the story behind “Predestination (2014)” in couple of pages</li>
          
            <li>It is really good, but I had recently watched the movie, would be much nicer if I hadn’t watched the movie before. The movie is almost identical to the book, but they filled it with some back story to make it more interesting and fill the time since this novelleta is so short.</li>
