            <li>I wanted to read this book for a while and it was worth reading. It&#39;s a very intriguing story and thought provoking. It&#39;s not an easy read, but well worth the effor. The ending is probably not the great (the very last part) but the story is very interesting and as I said though provoking.</li>

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.02</li>
          

          
            <li>The Foundation Trilogy is the best I’ve read! Probably better than the Song of Fire and Ice (we’ll see after it’s finished)</li>
          
            <li>But the amount of thought that is put into this book and how everything is connected and everything in the end makes sense. There is pretty much no false clues in the book (none that I saw).</li>

            <li>Really good, i started reading the 3rd one right after this book it was that good</li>

          <li>Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2014.12 - 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>I really liked this book, recommend. I even bough “Ad herenium” after (while) reading this book</li>
          
            <li>It has interesting techniques about memory, also is written very nicely so it is very interesting to read.</li>
          
            <li>I need to learn the Major System for remembering numbers and of course practice the method of loci to be able to use this in real life. Foer says that he didn’t find good applications for the knowledge other than being human by remembering, I like this idea, but I need to try to find useful applications myself before I can agree with him.</li>

          <li>Solaris by Stanislaw Lem </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>Very entertaining, my fist Lem novel. Written from first person. After Of Mice and Men I&#39;ve started noticing the way story is presented and how could it be converted to a movie so I should watch Solaris (2002) and see how they did.</li>
          
            <li>I really didn’t like Solaris (2002) movie, it tried to take some ideas out of the book (I didn’t get all of those ideas, but most of them) and force feeds to the audience. It solves all the narration by skipping it and creating a slightly different back story which doesn’t make much sense.</li>

          <li>Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>Nice short read, very unconventional story</li>
          
            <li>It was interesting reading in this novellete/play style. He actually though about presenting at n different media not just writing a book, I guess you are at the next level when you come up with a story and can present it in different media simultaneously without hurting the story</li>

          <li>The Variable Man by Philip K Dick </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>Had couple of very interesting ideas</li>
          
            <li>I’m not sure how I feel about the variable man, seems to fictional, but this is fiction and the character is well defined</li>

          <li>Childhood’s End by Arthur C Clarke </li>
        

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>It was a great read (Read it on my trip from EVN to LHR)</li>
          
            <li>Need to read couple more novels by Clarke</li>
          
            <li>Lots of ideas from this book are reused, V TV Series picks where this book starts and tries to take an alternative path, but their path was pretty mediocre.</li>

        <ul>
          
            <li>Date Read: 2015.01</li>
          

          
            <li>This is the story behind “Predestination (2014)” in couple of pages</li>
          
            <li>It is really good, but I had recently watched the movie, would be much nicer if I hadn’t watched the movie before. The movie is almost identical to the book, but they filled it with some back story to make it more interesting and fill the time since this novelleta is so short.</li>
