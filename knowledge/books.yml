      - I wanted to read this book for a while and it was worth reading. It's a very intriguing story and thought provoking. It's not an easy read, but well worth the effor. The ending is probably not the great (the very last part) but the story is very interesting and as I said though provoking.

      - If you are not an Armenian this could be a good way to understand feelings of Armenians about Armenian genocide! It has a very nice personal touch from the author that explains how he feels also give you some historical context of what actually happened, and why it's hard for an Armenian to tell you what happened.
      - If you are Armennian, it's equally good. Book describes how the authorsfeel and I could related to a lot of his feeling and he put a lot of feelings into words which I really liked.

      - Interesting to read what goes on in the mind of Zlatan. Other than that book is not very well organized, it seems like listening to a mind that strays away while telling its stories. Even with that it was an interesting read, you understand that even professional teams are supposed to be teams, and that professionals should have the desire to win to succeed.

      - I really liked this book. It seems that it's a story of life compressed into a year. At the same time it is also a look into a mind that you don't understand. Both because you don't understand retarted people and you don't understand geniouses and different problems them face.
      - It made me wonder if I'm becoming Charlie the Scientist as I try to learn more of everything, because while doing that I feel like I'm becoming lonelier than before. Maybe this is because of moving back to MIT, but still makes you think that smart and accomplished people are usually rude.

      - It was a nice book with a lot of examples of people that had characters. I like overall idea of the book and what it promotes, but I was not convinced by some of the examples it had. It made me think that US society is divided in a lot of parts, and the part that is non-South thinking (I don't know how else to discribe it), and has achieved something has a lot of values that that my parents taught me. So even though American mentality is far away from Armenian one, there is a set of core values of being human that is shared among both, but you have to dig for those and you only find those values in thinkers of the time.

      - It was a really nice read. I enjoyed it a lot. A very though provoking and makes you feel like how it feels to loose a war. So It does not really matter what is the regimen after a war. Loosing side suffers.
      - The idea of a book within a book was a very good one, and very well executed.
      - I watched the amazon TV series right after reading the book, and the series was good, but I think they understood the book differently. Or they did not want to convey the same message.

        It was a good book to understand how Peter Thiel thinks about startups.
        I definitely agree with a lot of points there, but I can not remember
        which of the ideas came from this book which from somewhere else. I like
        his 7 questions that all startups should ask themselves! It's a good
        book if you are considering starting a startup.

        I read this over long period if you consider that the book is only 150
        pages long. It was a nice book, with a nice buildup of what the society
        looks when people want to be happy all the time. Makes you think about
        what is the life about like any other good fictional book. It was
        entertaining, but I have read better scifi books.

        Very nice book and it didn't take too long to finish it. I will
        definitely read more of Arthur C. Clarke. This had a resemblence with
        Childhood's end in a way that it says that human race is not the
        dominant force in the universe.

        It had interesting stories, I wouldn't say I loved the book, but it
        was worth reading. Way better than other short stories I have read.
        There was a sense that he was telling stories about people that live
        in Dublin, but have very little in common.

        In the beginning I felt like reading the Bible, even though I haven't read
        it. Very entertaining, but dense and full of names that one must remember
        when reading. Reading in Kindle helped a lot because of the X-Ray feature.
        I'm not sure if I liked it to recommend to someone not already liking Game
        of Thrones of other works of Tolkein.

It makes you think about the values in life, and what is necessary for oneself to live. Very entertaining and I'd recommend, the only downside is that it's a pretty dark novel.

      - It has interesting techniques about memory, also is written very nicely so it is very interesting to read.
      - I need to learn the Major System for remembering numbers and of course practice the method of loci to be able to use this in real life. Foer says that he didn’t find good applications for the knowledge other than being human by remembering, I like this idea, but I need to try to find useful applications myself before I can agree with him.

      - Very entertaining, my fist Lem novel. Written from first person. After Of Mice and Men I've started noticing the way story is presented and how could it be converted to a movie so I should watch Solaris (2002) and see how they did.
      - I really didn’t like Solaris (2002) movie, it tried to take some ideas out of the book (I didn’t get all of those ideas, but most of them) and force feeds to the audience. It solves all the narration by skipping it and creating a slightly different back story which doesn’t make much sense.

        (2015.12) I watched Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972) and I liked it a
        lot. I think the movies made me look at the book in a slightly different
        way. The quote that I remembered from the movies was that we were
        looking for a contact with ET civilization but when we find it we have
        no idea what to do with it. Another good one was that human race doesn't
        want to conquer the universe, it wants to expand Earth to the boundaries
        of the universe. Great movie! I think I should read the book again in a
        year or so.

      - It is really good, but I had recently watched the movie, would be much nicer if I hadn’t watched the movie before. The movie is almost identical to the book, but they filled it with some back story to make it more interesting and fill the time since this novelleta is so short.
